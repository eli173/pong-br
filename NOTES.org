The general outline of the game is that we have some large number of players $n$, arranged in a $2n$-sided regular polygon, where the player has their pong-space, and is surrounded by two walls. The walls primarily serve the purpose of having the game end nicely when there are two players left: it becomes a regular game of pong.

I'm going to limit the number of players to 10 for the time being, I think anything with more than 20 sides might be a bit too much. 20 might be pushing it actually.


At the moment I think I've figured out basic matchmaking (the br format pretty much lets me ignore skill levels so I can just throw anyone with anyone), so the main concern is the actual pong gameplay. My biggest challenge is how to shrink the circle when someone dies.
There's gotta be a decent transformation I can come up with? Probably mostly trig. I've gotta work it so multiple things can go away at the same time.
