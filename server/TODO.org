list of things i should still do:
- fix collisions

sorta extra/for later/unsure:
- fiddle with variables to optimize fun
- make sure files are in the right place and urls are appropriate for server
- double check all on-screen messages for fitting (look to the 'magic number...' comment)
- fix game not ending with just robots (is this actually broken?)
- polish
- debug touch
